==============

This is a library for the AllThingsTalk ‘Internet of Things’ platform.  

It works with the official [Arduino leonardo Ethernet board](http://www.arduino.org/products/boards/arduino-leonardo-eth).  
Other boards based on Arduino might also work. In the Examples folder you can find some sample sketches which support the [Linkit ONE](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/LinkIt-ONE-p-2017.html) and for boards bases on the ESP8266 module, like the [nodeMCU](http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html).

### Installation
  1. Download the [source code](https://github.com/allthingstalk/arduino-client/archive/master.zip)
  2. copy the content of the 'libraries' directory in the zip file to your arduino libraries folder (usually found at &lt;arduinosketchfolder>/libraries).
  
### Example sketches

The library includes a number of example sketches which demonstrate how assets of different types can be used with the AllThingsTalk ‘Internet of Things’ platform and also includes examples to be used with other boards.

### Experiments

The download also includes a number of experiments to get you started with more features of  the AllThingsTalk ‘Internet of Things’ platform such as automation and notifications.
